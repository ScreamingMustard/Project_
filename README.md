<title> Mobile Legends</title> 
<h1></h1>
<p> Mobile Legends is a MOBA (mulitplayer online battle arena) based game. There are six turrents on each side and five players on each team. The object of the game is to destroy the enemies (opposing player) base. You can play as different character's but understand how they work and how to make use of their abilities. We have tanks, fighters, marksmen, mages and assassin's. </p>
<h2> Tanks </h2>
<p> Tanks are bulky and use lots of armor, they are best in the front when engagging in team fights. Some tanks can built as fighters depending on what kind of team you are matched up with. Tanks should stay in the front and have lots of armor. Tanks may not have a lot of damage but they often stop it. </p>
<h3> Franco </h3>
<p> Franco is one of my favorite tanks to have on a team. His most useful and power ability is his iron hook. His hook is cast out and whoever it snags is brought back to Franco causing 450 physical damage. It is best to use this ability around a fighter or marksman that way they can deal serious damage. His seocnd ability is fury shock, Franco stomps his feet and terrifies enemies causing 300 phyiscal damage and slowing down nearby enemies for 1.5s. It is best to use this ability after using his hook and snagging someone. Slowing them down will give your teammate(s) the advantage to kill them. Franco's last ability is called brutal massacre. This ability is called his 'ult' or ultimate which means his most power or useful skill. Franco hits the enemy multiple times disabling them and causing 70 physical damage per each six hits. </p>
<p> Akai </p>
<p> Akai is another powerful and useful tank but takes times to master. Akai's first ability is called the thousand pounder. Akai jumps into the target area dealing 170 physical damage to enemies when landing and a 55% slow down effect. For the next 3 seconds each of his basic attacks will deal an extra 50% damage> His second ability is called guardian
